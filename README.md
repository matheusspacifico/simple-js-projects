## What is this?
Just a few small projects in a single HTML page with pure Javascript, because why not.

## The code looks ugly!
I know, right?
Yes, it's very _lazyly_ written, but I'm mostly doing it for remembering Javascript functions, as I'm used with React.
Also, the CSS is in one single file lol

## Current Projects
- Simple calculator with an actual interface
- Currency calculator (brl to usd etc.) using EnchangeRate API (get your own api key btw)
- Tip calculator with a bill splitter
- Random color picker
